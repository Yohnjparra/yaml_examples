## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

here is a link to [GOOGLE](http://google.com)

here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_

when we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

Here are some examples R commands:

```
2 + 2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

Here is an example of a no-numbered list:

  1. Breakfast
      a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
      b. drink
        i. apple juice
        
  2. Lunch
      a. taco
      
  3. Dinner
      a. baked chicken
      b. brocoli
      c. rice
      
Here is an example of blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item

Here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > this text is nested

Here is an example of code in a blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
